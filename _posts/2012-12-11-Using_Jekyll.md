I ended up wanting github-style code blocks, so I'm using this plugin

```
https://github.com/nono/Jekyll-plugins
```

This allows me to write using pretty code blocks, such as:

<pre>
```ruby
  def lol
    puts "lol"
  end
```
</pre>

Except that it doesn't work on github pages, had to roll back :P
