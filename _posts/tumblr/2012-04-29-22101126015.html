title: Collaborative LaTeX Writing
---

<p>UPDATE: Of course <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Collaborative_Writing_of_LaTeX_Documents#Other_Methods">wikibooks</a> has the most complete list of online collaborative editors haha - I can&#8217;t believe I didn&#8217;t come across this last time I was looking these up!</p>



<p>So I have a writing project that I need to work on with a group of people, and trying to determine the best way to work on it. We can use Word for development of content, but we probably want to publish with LaTeX so it&#8217;d be great if we could get the team on that. But I can&#8217;t imagine convincing the people I work with to install, configure, and learn LaTeX. We&#8217;re better off collaborating on googledocs and spending some time converting it to LaTeX code in one run, but that&#8217;s clunky and hard to update :/</p>

<p>Alternatives for collaborative writing (thanks <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/3044/tools-for-collaborative-paper-writing">stackexchange</a>!)</p>

<ol><li>Googledocs is best for just writing text and copy into LaTeX when we&#8217;re done. Lol we&#8217;ll probably just do that.</li>

<li>Share .TeX files using dropbox - limited by two things: only one person can edit at a time and all contributors must have TeX installed. Not happening.</li>

<li>Share .TeX files using github or svn solves the one edit at a time problem, but wayy too much overhead for this situation.</li>

<li>Online LaTeX collaborative writing site!</li>

</ol><p>I can send my collaborators to a <strong>LaTeX website</strong>, they can probably deal with the simple LaTeX-code once we have a skeleton written. That would be beautiful! ;D</p>

<p><strong><br/></strong></p>

<p><strong>I&#8217;ve found two promising prospects</strong></p>

<ol><li><a href="http://writelatex.com" title="writelatex.com" target="_blank">WriteLatex</a> is still in beta, but it&#8217;s super promising. This is the interface I think I want. Collaborative textpad on the left, and the pdf on the right. This one works off of <a href="http://codemirror.net">CodeMirror</a> as its text editor.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/">ShareLatex</a> looks great too, and more polished. This one works off of <a href="http://ace.ajax.org/" title="Ace Editor" target="_blank">ace editor</a> as its text editor.</li>

</ol><p>I haven&#8217;t tested them (wanna try it with me? ;D), but I don&#8217;t think either is real-time in the way <a href="http://etherpad.org">etherpad</a> or googledocs are. I&#8217;d love for my LaTeX collaboration service to have real-time text input, real-time pdf generation, and support for LaTeX packages. I don&#8217;t think any option is quite there yet, but we&#8217;re off to a great start!</p>

<p>On the horizon, etherpad is developing a <a href="https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite/issues/121">syntax highlighting plugin</a> as we speak. Maybe it&#8217;ll do what I want soon? (but I&#8217;m not sure what codemirror/aceeditor has that I&#8217;d be missing out on, I haven&#8217;t checked them out yet)</p>

<p>There are two other projects I&#8217;m not quite as excited about:</p>

<ol><li><a href="http://docs.latexlab.org/">LatexLab</a> which is based off of googledocs (<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/internet-tips/latex-lab-use-google-docs-as-latex-editor/">ref</a>) but it seems like it hasn&#8217;t been updated since 2010?</li>

<li><a href="http://www.scribtex.com/">ScribTex</a> which seems totally developed but costs a yearly fee for any collaboration. Seems legit, but I don&#8217;t use LaTeX quite enough for this. (<a href="http://www.astrobetter.com/collaborative-latex-writing-a-review-of-scribtex/">a review</a>)</li>

</ol>
