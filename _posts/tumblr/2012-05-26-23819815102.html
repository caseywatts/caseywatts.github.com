title: Recipe Management Software
---

<p>Do you know where all of your recipes are? Mine are scattered throughout my gmail history, lost :/ </p>

<p>No more! I&#8217;m going to start using <a href="http://pepperplate.com">Pepper Plate</a>! Pepper Plate lets you <strong>import recipes</strong> from big websites like <a href="http://www.epicurious.com">Epicurious</a> and <a href="http://allrecipes.com">Allrecipes</a> and also from <a href="http://glutenfreegoddess.blogspot.com/2011/08/karinas-gluten-free-pancakes.html">blog posts</a>. Then it helps you make <strong>shopping lists</strong> out of these saved recipes. Then it helps you cook by displaying the recipes in a <strong>beautifully </strong><strong>formatted</strong>, standard way. On whatever devices you have. It&#8217;s amazing! :D</p>

<p>The rest of this post describes a lot of software that should just come together. Nothing does everything. For now I&#8217;d totally recommend trying out <a href="http://pepperplate.com">Pepper Plate</a> and making beautiful food-babies with it. Pepper Plate doesn&#8217;t do quite everything, but it meets my needs best. The competitors <a href="http://foodfolio.net">Foodfolio</a> and <a href="http://ziplist.com">ZipList</a> have some neat features too, but Foodfolio costs money eventually and Ziplist is kinda awkward to use.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br/>I&#8217;ve always wanted to put my recipes <strong>in one place</strong>. Currently, I email myself links to recipe <strong>websites and blogs</strong>. Recently I tagged a bunch of these emails with a label so I can find them again, but I missed a bunch and what I have is totally disorganized and I can&#8217;t find recipes for things I know I&#8217;ve made. Also I always <strong>modify the recipes</strong> to fit what common ingredients I have on hand, but that&#8217;s done in my head every single time. I don&#8217;t write down these modifications anywhere - and I do want to reduce the mental substitution-translation I have to do every time I cook.</p>

<p>I want to use only<strong> one service</strong> as my recipe hub. It needs to import data from both websites and blogs, and allow me to save my own recipes as well. <strong>Standards</strong> like <a href="http://www.schema.org/Recipe">Schema.org</a> pave the way to exchange of recipes. Thanks to standards, big websites like <a href="http://www.epicurious.com">Epicurious</a> and <a href="http://allrecipes.com">Allrecipes</a> are easy to extract recipes from. Unfortunately, none of the players I looked at could extract data from each other, so if you use one you&#8217;re pretty much locked in. In 3 years when you&#8217;re enticed to change software again you would have to do it manually. But it&#8217;s still probably better than your current system, at least you&#8217;ll have them!</p>

<p>Oh and also, I kinda want it to be <strong>free</strong>. More importantly, I want to use the same software as everybody else, and none of my peers would likely pay for this software either. There is a lot of mature, costly recipe management software available, but there are enough free ones available to make it silly to use those.</p>

<p>Computers ought to be able to help us in the kitchen in these ways:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Easy import</strong> of recipes from many sources. Click<em>one</em> button to take a recipe from a website OR blog, automatically formatting it in a standard way. I know blogs are hard to extract data from, but some services like <a href="http://ziplist.com">ZipList</a> do it pretty well (even if the rest of it is buggy). (Also in the future: easy, integrated feedback for these recipes, like allrecipes has! But that&#8217;s way far off.)</li>

<li>I want it to <strong>read beautifully </strong>in a clear, standard format on whatever devices I have lying around.</li>

<li>I want it to help me make my <strong>shopping list</strong>. ~70% of the groceries I buy are targeted at recipes. I don&#8217;t always buy sacks of potatoes without an idea for a potato dish.</li>

<li>I want the process to be <strong>social</strong>. After I&#8217;m done cooking and I have beautiful, delicious results and gorgeous photos, I want to share the recipe and the photo online with my friends and/or an interested online community. Or even better, just to +1 a recipe I used/modified, giving back to the collaborative cooking world. (Currently the iPod Tumblr app is how I would do this but it&#8217;s not best*)</li>

<li>Some people apparently want to plan <strong>meals and menus</strong>? Apps always try to make this function. But I&#8217;m definitely okay without that, I have more basic needs to meet first in my small private kitchen.</li>

</ol><p><br/>I&#8217;ve reviewed three apps below. Here&#8217;s the HTML-formatting key I always like to use:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Bold</strong> = best/easiest!</li>

<li>Normal = okay/acceptable</li>

<li><em>Italics</em> = weak/unacceptable</li>

<li><strike>Strikethrough</strike> = the feature is not even present</li>

</ul><p><strong><a href="http://pepperplate.com"><br/>Pepper Plate</a></strong></p>

<ul><li>Easy Import - it&#8217;s only easy on standardwebsites. Blogs require manual input</li>

<li>Shopping List - doesn&#8217;t guess what you have/don&#8217;t have like ZipList does</li>

<li><strong>Read Beautifully</strong></li>

<li><strike>Social</strike></li>

</ul><div>Price: Pepper Plate is totally free! I think the pretty iPad app costs money, but that&#8217;s not essential to enjoy this program.</div>

<div><strong><a href="http://foodfolio.net"><br/>Foodfolio</a></strong></div>

<ul><li>Easy Import - it&#8217;s only easy on standardwebsites. Blogs require manual input</li>

<li><strike>Shopping List</strike></li>

<li><strong>Read Beautifully</strong></li>

<li><strong>Social</strong> - it&#8217;s the only social one</li>

</ul><p>Price: Foodfolio is only free up to 100 recipes max. That is not sufficient for long-term use. The fact that they&#8217;re founded on being a social network would probably help them come out on top if this pricing scheme didn&#8217;t scare people like me away.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ziplist.com"><br/>ZipList</a></strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>Easy Import</strong></li>

<li><strong>Shopping List</strong></li>

<li><em>Read Beautifully</em></li>

<li><strike>Social</strike></li>

</ul><p>Ziplist actually has a frustrating interface and I don&#8217;t love it. But it still deserves mention for two reasons:</p>

<ol><li>It can extract data from many blog posts (at least the ingredients, which is a big part of it)</li>

<li>It facilitates shopping lists best of all the products. It guesses what you likely have/don&#8217;t have. They must use statistics! &gt;:D</li>

</ol><p>Price: ZipList is free! Buut I think this app is dying and on its way out. I hope they donate their code! It looks like their model was based off of suggesting which store you should go to, but that feature is horribly out of date. Neither New Haven grocery is in this app. <br/><br/> </p>

<p><em>*Why the Tumblr app is not best for sharing food: The easiest way to put recipes with pictures is difficult. I can use the iPod&#8217;s Tumblr app to upload a picture, save as a draft, then log in to my computer and search for the recipe and save that in the draft and then finally post the post to a theoretical Casey&#8217;s-food tumblr which is basically a picture and a link, no recipe, and nobody is following it anyway - lol the meal had better be damn good to make me do all of that! Blogs are okay, but not quite perfect for sharing recipes and food. They could do better.</em></p>
