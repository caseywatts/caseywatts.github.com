title: Yalies in New Haven: Summer 2012
---

<p>Will you be in New Haven this summer? Here is the facebook event that tells you who is here! <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/407594389274532/">&#8220;Yalies in New Haven: Summer 2012&#8221;</a></p>

<p>It was hard to decide whether to make it a group or an event, because facebook makes everything complicated. I&#8217;ve deduced that <strong>groups</strong> are better than events for this sort of thing, but since it&#8217;s so much easier to add people to an <strong>event </strong>we&#8217;re gonna go with the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/407594389274532/">event</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s why:<!-- more --></p>

<p><strong>Groups</strong></p>

<p>+ Groups are better because once it&#8217;s up you can create events <em>within</em> the group and invite all members of the group. Only the Yalies in New Haven need to know about the house party on Lynwood.</p>

<p>- BUT adding people to groups is so difficult. You have to type each name individually into a small box, and there&#8217;s no shortcut. AND anyone you add is automatically added to the group without their permission - regardless of whether they&#8217;ll even be in New Haven - and that&#8217;s not even useful.</p>

<p><strong>Events</strong></p>

<p>+ Event invitations on the other hand are the easiest thing - you can use a script to invite <a href="http://www.yalewiki.org/wiki/Undergraduate_Organizations#Inviting_People_to_Facebook_Events">all of your Yale-friends</a> at once. Those that will be here will join, and everyone else will ignore it. (It&#8217;s a good thing people are used to ignoring invitations. I wish we could target invitations better somehow! But that&#8217;s a major project for another post.)</p>

<p>- We can&#8217;t invite people to join events and stuff. But I think it&#8217;s okay because people ignore those anyway haha.</p>
