title: Yalies in New Haven = Travelogue?
---

<p><strong>Not quite yet.</strong></p>

<p>The situation: This summer while you travel (or stay put) you want to know who&#8217;s in the same city as you. You could be living on the same street as 5 friends and not even realize it!</p>

<p><a href="http://travelogueapp.com">Travelogue</a> is already a great solution for discovering who-went-where, and it&#8217;s actively developing. I admire this project and I expect Yalies will depend on this increasingly :D</p>

<p>However, it doesn&#8217;t quite work for Yalies in New Haven yet. This wasn&#8217;t the focus of the first iteration of this app, and that was probably a great decision. That does mean, however, that <strong>this summer, students will probably still use Facebook to communicate with other Yalies in New Haven.</strong></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Not optimized for large numbers.</strong> New Haven has hundreds of Yalies coming in and out all of the time, and Travelogue&#8217;s layout is better at displaying smaller numbers. Place view can only fit ~6 people on each of my screens. Map view&#8217;s bubbles list people, but that&#8217;s not quite ideal either.</li>

<li><strong>Not everyone uses it yet.</strong> Adoption by Yalies is impressive overall, but Yalies in New Haven don&#8217;t seem to be jumping on this app. &lt;100 Yalies have registered their trip to New Haven for during the peak of the summer. This might grow after finals, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll reach all Yalies this summer - it&#8217;s not the most useful for us here.</li>

<li>It&#8217;s difficult to visualize <strong>who will be here when</strong> throughout the summer. The map view tries to do this, but it&#8217;s not aimed at remaining stationary in a city with so many Yalies. Instead, a timeline-type view might do this elegantly - a horizontal bar which spans the screen representing the summer. And many horizontal bars, each one representing a person, with a length showing me when during the summer they&#8217;ll be here.</li>

<li><strong>Can&#8217;t filter out non-friends.</strong> In the place view you can&#8217;t filter out people you&#8217;re not fb-friends with. And in the map view, the &#8220;only show friends&#8221; button isn&#8217;t working for me.</li>

<li><strong>Travelogue doesn&#8217;t display events longer than 1 year very well.</strong> I&#8217;ll be in New Haven all summer and all next year. But my Travelogue post seems to suggest that I&#8217;ll be here for the next month only and that I just didn&#8217;t fill out my itinerary.  (&#8220;New Haven, CT on Apr 19 - May 31&#8221;). That&#8217;s just a low priority item for them they&#8217;ll get to soon I&#8217;m sure.</li>

<li>A feature that I want: <strong>What streets do my friends live on?</strong> I&#8217;d love to see who&#8217;s living in upper East Rock with me whether I&#8217;m friends or not. Maybe Travelogue will let us put in addresses in the future, and visualize the scene that way? :)</li>

<li>Another feature that I want: <strong>Dynamic email lists.</strong> I&#8217;d love to get emails about what&#8217;s going on in Quito, Ecuador while I&#8217;m there! But maybe only about things that will happen while I&#8217;m there. Travelogue has all of the data necessary for facilitating this sort of thing.</li>

</ol><p><strong><br/></strong></p>

<p>In conclusion, this was a lot of constructive criticism and I&#8217;m so excited to see where Travelogue goes! It isn&#8217;t focused on helping Yalies in New Haven yet, but I bet they&#8217;ll work all of these features in there soon! (by next break? hehe maybe)</p>
