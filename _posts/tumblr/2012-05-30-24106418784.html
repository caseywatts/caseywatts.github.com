title: IBS = Jessica The Cranky Tummy /Explanation/
---

<p><div>I have this weird science diet I have to follow so I don&#8217;t have bellyaches all of the time. I used to get weekly/bi-weekly bellyaches that made me curl up and lose whole days. So much that we even named my belly &#8220;Jessica&#8221; 6 years ago for being such a bitch - but no more! Here&#8217;s the sitch:<br/><br/><strong>IBS and Low-FODMAPs Diet.</strong> I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome (<span class="il">IBS</span>) which is an ill-defined digestive disorder which we have in my family. To treat it, I follow the &#8220;<strong>Low-FODMAPs Diet</strong>&#8221; (low <strong>F</strong>ermentable <strong>O</strong>ligo/<strong>D</strong>i/<strong>M</strong>ono-saccharides <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>P</strong>olyol<strong>s</strong>) by avoiding a long list of chemically related food. The low-FODMAP diet is considered the most effective current treatment of IBS by the scientific community, and my gastroenterologist prescribed it to me. Science doesn&#8217;t really know why <em>I&#8217;m</em> susceptible to FODMAPs and other people are just fine, but we do know how this diet does its magic.<br/><br/><strong>It&#8217;s Science.</strong> Human and rat studies have shown that this set of food (FODMAPs) isn&#8217;t digested well by us mammals. And since we can&#8217;t digest it, it&#8217;s instead digested by greedy gut bacteria which go on to make acid and gas and shit :&lt; But the symptoms of IBS can subside when we starve those naughty bacteria. By not eating this set of food, I can avoid the problem! <em>(I can&#8217;t wait for the day where we understand the root cause and fix /that/ instead of just avoiding the problem. <span>Science, full speed ahead!</span>)<br/><br/></em><strong>It&#8217;s Kinda Hard.</strong> Even though IBS is ill-defined and has many different causes, this diet is effective on so many people that it&#8217;s totally worth giving a shot! But it&#8217;s complicated and describes /so many/ food that are triggers that it&#8217;s difficult to do well. For two months trying to follow this diet I still had bellyaches just about as frequently as before - except I could point at <em>exactly</em> which food the triggers were once equipped with the FODMAP knowledge. And the learning process began.<br/><br/><strong>But It&#8217;s Kinda Flexible!</strong> Now I understand what counts and doesn&#8217;t so well that I manage to successfully &#8220;cheat&#8221;. As long as I minimize transgressions I feel just fine. For instance, I recently had bechamel sauce made with a pinch of flour (which has a nasty FODMAP in it - fructans), and it didn&#8217;t even hurt me ^_~</div>

<li>There are also a number of IBS/low-FODMAP blogs you can find by google searching, and I trust them pretty well when they cite their sources.</li>
